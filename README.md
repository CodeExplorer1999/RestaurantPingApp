# RestaurantPingApp
This is a mobile app where users can register any restaurant they would like into the app. The app will then get the information from these restaurants using HTTP requests alongside the Google Maps Api and will store the collected data in an SQL database. The user will then receive a notification if they are within 5 kilometers of a saved restaurant.
